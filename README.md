# traffic-deaction-appcloudcredits
Detect anomalies in network traffic data to identify potential security threats or unusual activity. Use unsupervised learning techniques like clustering or autoencoders. Visualize normal vs. anomalous traffic patterns.
# ðŸš¦ Embedded System Network Attack Detector

This Streamlit web app detects potential cyber-attacks in embedded system traffic using a trained machine learning model.

## ðŸš€ How It Works

- Trained on real network traffic dataset
- Accepts input features like packet size, protocol, flags, etc.
- Predicts whether the traffic is benign or malicious

## ðŸ§  Model Info

- Model: Random Forest Classifier
- Accuracy: ~X% (fill after training)
- Trained with `retrain_model.py`

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

Clone the repo and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/traffic_deactor_app.git
cd traffic_deactor_app
pip install -r requirements.txt
